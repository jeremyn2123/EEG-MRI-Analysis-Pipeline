# EEG-MRI-Analysis-Pipeline

The scripts for this pipeline were developed for my Honour's Thesis, on the feasibility of EEG acquisition during functional conductivity imaging. 
This is a novel functional MRI sequence based off magnetic resonance electric properties tomography (MREPT) using balance fast field echo (bFFE) to 
obtain conductivity/permittivity maps of human tissue using standard MR hardware. 

Unfortunately, they only work for the Curry9 EEG-MRI files obtained during this project. 
I will hopefully be updating them to work for any/most EEG-MRI data files, and will upload these scripts when I can after my submission deadline.
The AAS code is based off of Niazy et al., (2005), with some modifications. They do not exactly follow the algorithm outlined, so I will also upload
a version of each (fMRI and fCI) that replicate Niazy completely.
